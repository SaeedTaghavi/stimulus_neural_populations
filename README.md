### Abstract

Electrical stimulation of neural populations is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and developing treatments. To investigate the effects of external stimulation on a basic cortical motif, we analyse the dynamical properties of an efficient mean-field neural mass model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons and validate the results using detailed network simulations. 
The state space of the mean-field model and of the detailed network are closely related. They reveal asynchronous up and down-states, bistable regions, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. 
Within this dynamical landscape, external stimuli can cause state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. The effects of external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models. 	


## Getting Started

In this repository, you find the simulation engine for a) a fast and efficient mean-field mneural mass model of a large network of [AdEx neurons](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Adaptive_exponential_integrate-and-fire_model) and b) the corresponding network simulation of individual neurons implemented in [Brian2](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2). Furthermore, you will find numerous [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, that will show you how to run simulations and experiments, save the data, and recreate the figures found in our article.

### Prerequisites

Please install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for python 2.7 on your computer before you clone this repository.

### Installing

To make it easier to run the code in this project and reproduce our findings, we have created an anaconda environment. This helps you to get all the correct versions of the libraries we have used as well as python 2.7. 

The following command creates the anaconda environment on your computer:

```
conda env create -f nip27.yml
```
